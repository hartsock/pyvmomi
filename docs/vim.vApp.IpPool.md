| property | type | optional | priv | desc |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-----|
| id | int | true | None | Unique ID, generated by the server. This is used to identify the pool in  subsequent lookups or updates. The generated value is also returned by the <a href="vim.IpPoolManager.md#createIpPool">CreateIpPool</a> method. |
| name | string | true | None | Pool name.  <p>  The pool name must be unique within the datacenter.  <p>  Any / (slash), \ (backslash), character used in this  name element is escaped. Similarly, any % (percent) character used in  this name element is escaped, unless it is used to start an escape  sequence. A slash is escaped as %2F or %2f. A backslash is escaped as %5C or  %5c, and a percent is escaped as %25. |
| ipv4Config | [vim.vApp.IpPool.IpPoolConfigInfo](vim.vApp.IpPool.IpPoolConfigInfo.md "vim.vApp.IpPool.IpPoolConfigInfo") | true | None | IPv4 configuration.  <p>  This configuration is always present on the pool. To disable allocation, set the  ipPoolEnabled flag of the config to false. |
| ipv6Config | [vim.vApp.IpPool.IpPoolConfigInfo](vim.vApp.IpPool.IpPoolConfigInfo.md "vim.vApp.IpPool.IpPoolConfigInfo") | true | None | IPv6 configuration.  <p>  This configuration is always present on the pool. To disable allocation, set the  ipPoolEnabled flag of the config to false. |

| availableIpv4Addresses | int | true | None | The number of IPv4 addresses available for allocation. |
| availableIpv6Addresses | int | true | None | The number of IPv6 addresses available for allocation. |

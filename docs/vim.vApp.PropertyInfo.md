A vApp Property description, including deployment values

| property | type | optional | priv | desc |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-----|
| key | int | None | None | A unique integer key for the property. |
| classId | string | true | None | class name for this property  <p>  Valid values for classId:  Any string except any white-space characters  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| instanceId | string | true | None | class name for this property  <p>  Valid values for instanceId:  Any string except any white-space characters  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| id | string | true | None | Name of property. In the OVF environment, the property is listed as   [classId.]id[.instanceId]. The [classId.]name[.instanceId] must be unique.   <p>   This field cannot be empty for a property. Thus, it must be specified at creation   and cannot be set to the empty string.  <p>  Valid values for id:  Any string except any white-space characters  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| category | string | true | None | A user-visible description the category the property belongs to.  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| label | string | true | None | The display name for the property.  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| type | string | true | None | Describes the valid format of the property.   <p>   A type must be one of:   <ul>   <li>string : A generic string. Max length 65535 (64k).   <li>string(x..) : A string with minimum character length x.   <li>string(..y) : A string with maximum character length y.   <li>string(x..y) : A string with minimum character length x and maximum                     character length y.   <li>string["choice1", "choice2", "choice3"] : A set of choices. " inside a choice   must be either \" or ' e.g "start\"middle\"end" or "start'middle'end" and   a \ inside a string choice must be encoded as \\ e.g. "start\\end".   <li>int : An integer value. Is semantically equivalent to   int(-2147483648..2147483647) e.g. signed int32.   <li>int(x..y): An integer value with a minimum size x and a maximum size y.   For example int(0..255) is a number between 0 and 255 both incl. This is   also a way to specify that the number must be a uint8. There is always a lower   and lower bound. Max number of digits is 100 including any sign. If exported to OVF the   value will be truncated to max of uint64 or int64.   <li>real : IEEE 8-byte floating-point value.   <li>real(x..y) : IEEE 8-byte floating-point value with a minimum size x and a   maximum size y. For example real(-1.5..1.5) must be a number between -1.5 and 1.5.   Because of the nature of float some conversions can truncate the value.   Real must be encoded acording to CIM:   RealValue = [ "+" | "-" } *decimalDigit "." 1*decimalDigit               [ ("e" | "E" ) [ "+" | "-" ] 1*decimalDigit ] ]   <li>boolean : A boolean. The value can be True or False   <li>password       : A generic string. Max length 65535 (64k).   <li>password(x..)  : A string with minimum character length x.   <li>password(..y)  : A string with maximum character length y.   <li>password(x..y) : A string with minimum character length x and maximum                        character length y.   <li>ip  : An IPv4 address in dot-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in             colon-hexadecimal notation.   <li>ip:network  : An IP address in dot-notation (IPv4) and colon-hexadecimal (IPv6)                     on a particular network. The behavior of this type depends on the                     ipAllocationPolicy. See below.   <li>expression: The default value specifies an expression that is calculated                   by the system.   </ul>   For properties of type 'password', the value field and default value field will   always be returned as an empty string when queried. Thus, it is a write-only property.   Typically, a client application will also render these as a text field with hidden   text and double prompting.   <br>   An expression follows the general patterns of either ${arg} or ${cmd:arg}. The   list of supported expressions are listed below:   <ul>   <li> ${&lt;name&gt;} : This expression evaluates to the same value as the named                          property in the parent vApp. A parent vApp is the                          first vApp in the ancestry chain (resource pools are                          skipped). If no parent vApp exists or the property is                          not defined on the parent vApp, the expression                          evaluates to the empty value.   <li> ${subnet:&lt;network&gt;}  : The subnet value of the given network.   <li> ${netmask:&lt;network&gt;} : The netmask value of the given network.   <li> ${gateway:&lt;network&gt;} : The gateway value of the given network.   <li> ${autoIp:&lt;network&gt;}  : An auto-assigned network address on the given                                     network   <li> ${net:&lt;network&gt;}     : The name of the network   <li> ${domainName:&lt;network&gt;} : The DNS domain name, e.g., vmware.com, of                                     the given network.   <li> ${searchPath:&lt;network&gt;} : The DNS search path, e.g.,                                      eng.vmware.com;vmware.com, of the given                                      network.   <li> ${hostPrefix:&lt;network&gt;}: The host prefix on a given network,  e.g.,                                       "voe-"   <li> ${dns:network}: A comma-separated string of configured network addresses   <li> ${httpProxy:network}: The hostname:port for a proxy on the network   <li> ${vimIp:} : The IP address of the VIM API provider server. This would                     typical be an ESX Server or VirtualCenter Server.   </ul>   A vApp will fail to start if any of the properties cannot be computed. For   example, if a property reference a gateway on a network, for which is has not   been specified. The value of the computed computation is assigned to the 'value'   field upon start of the vApp or virtual machine. The value is cleared once   the vApp or virtual machine is not-running.   <p>   The system provides three ways of specifying IP addresses:   <ul>     <li>ip,</li>     <li>ip:network type,</li>     <li>${ip:network} expression.</li>   </ul>   The <em>ip</em> types are typically used to specify an IP addressed to an   external system. Thus, these are not used by a virtual ethernet adapter   within the guest itself. Both the ip:network expression and the ${ip:network}   expression are intended as a way to obtain an IP address for a virtual machine   in a vApp.   <p>   The behavior of ip:network type is controlled by the ipAssignPolicy, as   described in the following table:    <table>     <tr>        <td><strong>Policy</strong></td>        <td>ip:&lt;network&gt; type</td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>DHCP</td>      <td>The user is not prompted to enter a value. The variable is set to the          empty string during power-on, and later updated with the IP value reported          by the guest software.      </td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>Transient</td>      <td>The user is not prompted to enter a value. An IP address is allocated by          the platform and is assigned to the variable which is available to the          guest. The IP address is released at power-off.</td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>Fixed</td>      <td>The user is prompted to enter a value. This value is available to the          guest.</td>   </tr>   <tr>      <td>Fixed Allocated</td>      <td>The user is not prompted to enter a value. An IP address is allocated by          the platform and is assigned to the variable which is available to the          guest. The IP address remains allocated at power-off, and are only          released if the property is deleted or the vApp is destroyed.</td>   </tr>  </table>   <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| typeReference | string | true | None | Contains extra configuration data depending on the property type. For types that  refer to network names the type reference is the managed object reference  of the network. |
| userConfigurable | bool | true | None | Whether the property is user-configurable or a system property. This is not used   if the type is expression.  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |
| defaultValue | string | true | None | This either contains the default value of a field (used if value is empty   string), or the expression if the type is "expression". See comment for the |
| value | string | true | None | The value of the field at deployment time. For expressions, this will contain    the value that has been computed.  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.InstanceConfig |
| description | string | true | None | A description of the field.  <p>  Reconfigure privilege: VApp.ApplicationConfig |

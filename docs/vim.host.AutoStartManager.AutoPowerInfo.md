vim.host.AutoStartManager.AutoPowerInfo
=======================================
inherits from [vmodl.DynamicData](docs/vmodl.DynamicData.md)


This object type describes the power-on / power-off behavior for a given virtual   machine. Virtual machines can be configured to wait for a period of time before   starting or to wait to receive a successful heartbeat from a virtual machine   before starting the next virtual machine in the sequence.    <ul>      <li>For a power-on operation, if waitForHeartbeat is true, then the power-on          sequence continues after the first heartbeat has been received. If          waitForHeartbeat is false, the system waits for the specified delay and          then continues the power-on sequence.      <li>For a power-off operation, if delay is non-zero, the requested power-off          action is invoked (powerOff, suspend, guestShutdown) on the virtual          machine and the system waits until the number of seconds specified in the          delay have passed.    </ul>   If startAction and stopAction for a virtual machine are both set to none, that   virtual machine is removed from the AutoStart sequence.    Virtual machines can be configured both to wait for a period of time before   starting and to wait for a heartbeat. In such a case, the waiting virtual machine   only waits until either of these conditions are met. In other words, a virtual   machine starts in either of the following cases:    <ul>      <li>After receiving a heartbeat but before the start delay has elapsed      <li>After the start delay has elapsed but before receiving a heartbeat    </ul>   This provides a better experience since as soon as one virtual machine begins   sending heartbeats, indicating it has successfully started up, the next machine   will begin starting up. This happens even if the startDelay has not yet elapsed.   Similarly, if one virtual machine fails to begin sending heartbeats, perhaps   because it could not start up, other machines are not blocked from starting up   since the startDelay eventually elapses.

| property | type | optional | priv | desc |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-----|
| key | [vim.VirtualMachine](vim.VirtualMachine.md "vim.VirtualMachine") | None | None | Virtual machine to power on or power off. |
| startOrder | int | None | None | The autostart priority of this virtual machine. Virtual machines with a lower   number are powered on first. On host shutdown, the virtual machines are   shut down in reverse order, meaning those with a higher number are powered off   first.   <p>   Positive values indicate a start order and -1 indicates the machine can be   powered on at any time. Machines with a -1 value are typically powered on and   off after all virtual machines with positive startOrder values. Failure to   meet the following requirements results in an InvalidArgument exception:   <ul>     <li>startOrder must be set to -1 if startAction is set to none     <li>startOrder must be -1 or positive integers. Values such as 0 or         -2 are not valid.     <li>startOrder is relative to other virtual machines in the autostart         sequence. Hence specifying a startOrder of 4 when there are only 3         virtual machines in the Autostart sequence is not valid.   </ul>   <p>   If a newly established or changed startOrder value for a virtual machine   matches an existing startOrder value, the newly applied value takes   precedence, and the existing value is incremented by one. The incremented   startOrder value is checked for collisions, and the same rule is applied if   one is found. This simple system ensures no two virtual machines ever have the   same order number.   <p>   For example, consider the case where there are three virtual machines with   different startOrder values. Virtual machine A has not yet established a   startOrder, virtual machine B has a startOrder value of 1 and Virtual Machine   C has a startOrder value of 2. If virtual machine A's startOrder is set to 1,   then virtual machine B's startOrder is incremented to 2. This creates a   conflict with virtual machine C's startOrder value, which is also incremented,   this time to 3. |
| startDelay | int | None | None | Delay in seconds before continuing with the next virtual machine in the order   of machines to be started. If the delay is specified as -1, then the system   default is used. |
| waitForHeartbeat | [vim.host.AutoStartManager.AutoPowerInfo.WaitHeartbeatSetting](vim.host.AutoStartManager.AutoPowerInfo.WaitHeartbeatSetting.md "vim.host.AutoStartManager.AutoPowerInfo.WaitHeartbeatSetting") | None | None |  |
| startAction | string | None | None | How to start the virtual machine. Valid settings are none or powerOn.   If set to none, then the virtual machine does not participate in auto-start. |
| stopDelay | int | None | None | Delay in seconds before continuing with the next virtual machine in the order   sequence. If the delay is -1, then the system default is used. |
| stopAction | string | None | None | Defines the stop action for the virtual machine. Can be set to none,   systemDefault, powerOff, or suspend. If set to none, then the virtual machine   does not participate in auto-stop. |

vim.vm.customization.GuiUnattended
==================================
inherits from [vmodl.DynamicData](docs/vmodl.DynamicData.md)


The GuiUnattended type maps to the GuiUnattended key in the <tt>sysprep.inf</tt>   answer file. These values are plugged directly into the <tt>sysprep.inf</tt> file   that VirtualCenter stores on the target virtual disk. For more detailed   information, see the document <a href =   "http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Windows2000Pro/deploy/unattend/default.mspx"   >Windows 2000 Unattended Setup Guide</a>.

| property | type | optional | priv | desc |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-----|
| password | [vim.vm.customization.Password](vim.vm.customization.Password.md "vim.vm.customization.Password") | true | None | The new administrator password for the machine. To specify that the password   should be set to blank (that is, no password), set the password value to NULL.   Because of encryption, "" is NOT a valid value.   <p>   If the XML file is generated by the VirtualCenter Customization Wizard, then the   password is encrypted. Otherwise, the client should set the plainText attribute   to true, so that the customization process does not attempt to decrypt the   string. |
| timeZone | int | None | None | The time zone for the new virtual machine. Numbers correspond to time zones   listed in sysprep documentation at <a href =   "http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000pro/deploy/unattend/sp1ch01.mspx"   Unattend.txt File Parameters</a> in Microsoft Technet. |
| autoLogon | bool | None | None | Flag to determine whether or not the machine automatically logs on as   Administrator.  See also the password property. |
| autoLogonCount | int | None | None | If the AutoLogon flag is set, then the AutoLogonCount property specifies the   number of times the machine should automatically log on as Administrator.   Generally it should be 1, but if your setup requires a number of reboots, you   may want to increase it. This number may be determined by the list of commands   executed by the <a href="vim.vm.customization.GuiRunOnce.md">GuiRunOnce</a> command. |

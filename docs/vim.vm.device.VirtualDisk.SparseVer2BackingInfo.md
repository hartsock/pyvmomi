vim.vm.device.VirtualDisk.SparseVer2BackingInfo
===============================================
inherits from [vim.vm.device.VirtualDevice.FileBackingInfo](docs/vim.vm.device.VirtualDevice.FileBackingInfo.md)


This data object type contains information about backing a virtual disk by   using a virtual disk file on the host, in the sparse disk format used by   VMware Server.

| property | type | optional | priv | desc |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-----|
| diskMode | string | None | None | The disk persistence mode. Valid modes are:   <ul>   <li><a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDiskOption.DiskMode.md#persistent">persistent</a>   <li><a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDiskOption.DiskMode.md#independent_persistent">independent_persistent</a>   <li><a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDiskOption.DiskMode.md#independent_nonpersistent">independent_nonpersistent</a>   </ul><br>See <a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDiskOption.DiskMode.md">VirtualDiskMode</a><br> |
| split | bool | true | None | Flag to indicate the type of virtual disk file: split or monolithic.   If true, the virtual disk is stored in multiple files, each 2GB. |
| writeThrough | bool | true | None | Flag to indicate whether writes should go directly to the file system   or should be buffered. |
| spaceUsedInKB | long | true | None | The space in use for this sparse disk. This information is provided  when retrieving configuration information for an exisiting virtual  machine. The client cannot modify this information using reconfigure  on a virtual machine. |
| uuid | string | true | None | Disk UUID for the virtual disk, if available. |
| contentId | string | true | None | Content ID of the virtual disk file, if available.  <p>  A content ID indicates the logical contents of the disk backing and its parents.  <p>  This property is only guaranteed to be up to date if this disk backing is not  currently being written to by any virtual machine.  <p>  The only supported operation is comparing if two content IDs are equal or not.  The guarantee provided by the content ID is that if two disk backings have the  same content ID and are not currently being written to, then reads issued from  the guest operating system to those disk backings will return the same data. |
| changeId | string | true | None | The change ID of the virtual disk for the corresponding  snapshot or virtual machine. This can be used to track  incremental changes to a virtual disk. See   <a href="vim.VirtualMachine.md#queryChangedDiskAreas">QueryChangedDiskAreas</a>. |
| parent | [vim.vm.device.VirtualDisk.SparseVer2BackingInfo](vim.vm.device.VirtualDisk.SparseVer2BackingInfo.md "vim.vm.device.VirtualDisk.SparseVer2BackingInfo") | true | None | The parent of this virtual disk file, if this is a delta disk backing.  This will be unset if this is not a delta disk backing.  <p>  A delta disk backing is a way to preserve a virtual disk backing  at some point in time.  A delta disk backing is a file backing which in  turn points to the original virtual disk backing (the parent).  After a delta  disk backing is added, all writes go to the delta disk backing.  All reads  first try the delta disk backing and then try the parent backing if needed.  <p>  A delta disk backing can be added to a disk either implicitly during  snapshot operations, or explicitly during create or reconfigure of the virtual  machine.  <p>  Note that the type of the backing is consistent throughout the chain; any new  delta disk backing which is added is of the same type as the original disk .  Also note that since the parent backing is not being written to,  it is possible that the parent backing may be shared among multiple  disks belonging to multiple virtual machines.  <p>  During virtual machine <a href="vim.Folder.md#createVm">creation</a> and  <a href="vim.VirtualMachine.md#reconfigure">reconfiguration</a> this property is  only checked if the <a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDeviceSpec.md">VirtualDeviceConfigSpec</a> specifies  an <a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDeviceSpec.Operation.md#add">add operation</a> with a  <a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDeviceSpec.FileOperation.md#create">create file operation</a>.  In this case, a new delta disk backing is created which points to the parent  disk backing.  Only the <a href="vim.vm.device.VirtualDevice.FileBackingInfo.md#fileName">fileName</a>  property is important; all other properties will be ignored.  The parent backing  is assumed to exist and will not be recursively created.  <p>  This property may only be set if  <a href="vim.host.Capability.md#deltaDiskBackingsSupported">deltaDiskBackingsSupported</a>  is true. |

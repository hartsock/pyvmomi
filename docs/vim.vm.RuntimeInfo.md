vim.vm.RuntimeInfo
==================
inherits from [vmodl.DynamicData](docs/vmodl.DynamicData.md)


The RuntimeInfo data object type provides information about   the execution state and history of a virtual machine.

| property | type | optional | priv | desc |
|:---------|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-----|
| device | [vim.vm.DeviceRuntimeInfo](vim.vm.DeviceRuntimeInfo.md "vim.vm.DeviceRuntimeInfo") | true | None | Per-device runtime info. This array will be empty if the host   software does not provide runtime info for any of the device   types currently in use by the virtual machine.    In releases after vSphere API 5.0, vSphere Servers might not   generate property collector update notifications for this property.   To obtain the latest value of the property, you can use   PropertyCollector methods RetrievePropertiesEx or WaitForUpdatesEx.   If you use the PropertyCollector.WaitForUpdatesEx method, specify   an empty string for the version parameter.    Since this property is on a DataObject, an update returned by WaitForUpdatesEx may   contain values for this property when some other property on the DataObject changes.   If this update is a result of a call to WaitForUpdatesEx with a non-empty   version parameter, the value for this property may not be current. |
| host | [vim.HostSystem](vim.HostSystem.md "vim.HostSystem") | true | None | The host that is responsible for running a virtual machine.   This property is null if the virtual machine is not running and is   not assigned to run on a particular host. |
| connectionState | [vim.VirtualMachine.ConnectionState](vim.VirtualMachine.ConnectionState.md "vim.VirtualMachine.ConnectionState") | None | None | Indicates whether or not the virtual machine is available for management. |
| powerState | [vim.VirtualMachine.PowerState](vim.VirtualMachine.PowerState.md "vim.VirtualMachine.PowerState") | None | None | The current power state of the virtual machine. |
| faultToleranceState | [vim.VirtualMachine.FaultToleranceState](vim.VirtualMachine.FaultToleranceState.md "vim.VirtualMachine.FaultToleranceState") | None | None | The fault tolerance state of the virtual machine. |
| dasVmProtection | [vim.vm.RuntimeInfo.DasProtectionState](vim.vm.RuntimeInfo.DasProtectionState.md "vim.vm.RuntimeInfo.DasProtectionState") | true | None | The vSphere HA protection state for a virtual machine. Property   is unset if vSphere HA is not enabled. |
| toolsInstallerMounted | bool | None | None | Flag to indicate whether or not the VMware Tools installer   is mounted as a CD-ROM. |
| suspendTime | datetime | true | None | The timestamp when the virtual machine was most recently suspended.   <p>   This property is updated every time the virtual machine is suspended. |
| bootTime | datetime | true | None | The timestamp when the virtual machine was most recently powered on.   <p>   This property is updated when the virtual machine is powered on   from the poweredOff state, and is cleared when the virtual machine is   powered off. This property is not updated when a virtual machine is resumed   from a suspended state. |
| suspendInterval | long | true | None | The total time the virtual machine has been suspended   since it was initially powered on. This time excludes the current period,   if the virtual machine is currently suspended.  This property is updated   when the virtual machine resumes, and is reset to zero when the virtual machine   is powered off. |
| question | [vim.vm.QuestionInfo](vim.vm.QuestionInfo.md "vim.vm.QuestionInfo") | true | None | The current question, if any, that is blocking the virtual machine's execution. |
| memoryOverhead | long | true | None | The amount of memory resource (in bytes) that will be used by   the virtual machine above its guest memory requirements.   This value is set if and only if the virtual machine is registered   on a host that supports memory resource allocation features.   <p>   For powered off VMs, this is the minimum overhead required to   power on the VM on the registered host.   <p>   For powered on VMs, this is the current overhead reservation, a   value which is almost always larger than the minimum overhead, and   which grows with time.   <p><br>See <a href="vim.HostSystem.md#queryOverheadEx">QueryMemoryOverheadEx</a><br> |
| maxCpuUsage | int | true | None | Current upper-bound on CPU usage. The upper-bound is based on the host   the virtual machine is current running on, as well as limits configured   on the virtual machine itself or any parent resource pool.   Valid while the virtual machine is running.    In releases after vSphere API 5.0, vSphere Servers might not   generate property collector update notifications for this property.   To obtain the latest value of the property, you can use   PropertyCollector methods RetrievePropertiesEx or WaitForUpdatesEx.   If you use the PropertyCollector.WaitForUpdatesEx method, specify   an empty string for the version parameter.    Since this property is on a DataObject, an update returned by WaitForUpdatesEx may   contain values for this property when some other property on the DataObject changes.   If this update is a result of a call to WaitForUpdatesEx with a non-empty   version parameter, the value for this property may not be current. |
| maxMemoryUsage | int | true | None | Current upper-bound on memory usage. The upper-bound is based on memory   configuration of the virtual machine, as well as limits configured   on the virtual machine itself or any parent resource pool.   Valid while the virtual machine is running.    In releases after vSphere API 5.0, vSphere Servers might not   generate property collector update notifications for this property.   To obtain the latest value of the property, you can use   PropertyCollector methods RetrievePropertiesEx or WaitForUpdatesEx.   If you use the PropertyCollector.WaitForUpdatesEx method, specify   an empty string for the version parameter.    Since this property is on a DataObject, an update returned by WaitForUpdatesEx may   contain values for this property when some other property on the DataObject changes.   If this update is a result of a call to WaitForUpdatesEx with a non-empty   version parameter, the value for this property may not be current. |
| numMksConnections | int | None | None | Number of active MKS connections to this virtual machine. |
| recordReplayState | [vim.VirtualMachine.RecordReplayState](vim.VirtualMachine.RecordReplayState.md "vim.VirtualMachine.RecordReplayState") | None | None | Record / replay state of this virtual machine. |
| cleanPowerOff | bool | true | None | For a powered off virtual machine, indicates whether the virtual    machine's last shutdown was an orderly power off or not. Unset if    the virtual machine is running or suspended. |
| needSecondaryReason | string | true | None | If set, indicates the reason the virtual machine needs a secondary. |
| onlineStandby | bool | None | None | This property indicates whether the guest has gone into one of the    s1, s2 or s3 standby modes, false indicates the guest is awake. |
| minRequiredEVCModeKey | string | true | None | For a powered-on or suspended virtual machine in a cluster with Enhanced   VMotion Compatibility (EVC) enabled, this identifies the least-featured   EVC mode (among those for the appropriate CPU vendor) that could admit   the virtual machine. See <a href="vim.EVCMode.md">EVCMode</a>. This property will   be unset if the virtual machine is powered off or is not in an EVC   cluster.   <p>   This property may be used as a general indicator of the CPU feature   baseline currently in use by the virtual machine. However, the virtual   machine may be suppressing some of the features present in the CPU   feature baseline of the indicated mode, either explicitly (in the   virtual machine's configured   <a href="vim.vm.ConfigInfo.md#cpuFeatureMask">cpuFeatureMask</a>) or implicitly   (in the default masks for the   <a href="vim.vm.GuestOsDescriptor.md">GuestOsDescriptor</a> appropriate for the   virtual machine's configured guest OS). |
| consolidationNeeded | bool | None | None | Whether any disk of the virtual machine requires consolidation.   This can happen for example when a snapshot is deleted but its   associated disk is not committed back to the base disk.    Use <a href="vim.VirtualMachine.md#consolidateDisks">ConsolidateVMDisks_Task</a> to consolidate if   needed. |
| offlineFeatureRequirement | [vim.vm.FeatureRequirement](vim.vm.FeatureRequirement.md "vim.vm.FeatureRequirement") | true | None | These requirements must have equivalent host capabilities   <a href="vim.host.ConfigInfo.md#featureCapability">featureCapability</a> in order to power on. |
| featureRequirement | [vim.vm.FeatureRequirement](vim.vm.FeatureRequirement.md "vim.vm.FeatureRequirement") | true | None | These requirements must have equivalent host capabilities   <a href="vim.host.ConfigInfo.md#featureCapability">featureCapability</a> in order to power on,   resume, or migrate to the host. |
| featureMask | [vim.host.FeatureMask](vim.host.FeatureMask.md "vim.host.FeatureMask") | true | None | The masks applied to an individual virtual machine as a result of its   configuration. |
| vFlashCacheAllocation | long | true | None | Specifies the total allocated vFlash resource for the vFlash caches associated with VM's  VMDKs when VM is powered on, in bytes. |
